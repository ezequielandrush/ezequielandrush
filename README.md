- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ezequielandrush. I am working as a IT freelancer.
  I have more than 20 years of experience as a SysAdmin. I started with an old SCO Unix, moved to linux and in 2018 I added containers technologies like docker and kubernetes.
  I also worked with IaC with terraform and also I have experience working with Ansible. I can do some scripting with Python
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology as a whole. I love tinkering with Arduino boards and I have a (nearly dead) project of a robot. I'd like to finish that one day, but couldn't find the time yet.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all I can about kubernetes. Man, I love kubernetes. 
- ðŸ“« Feel free to contact me via DM or email
